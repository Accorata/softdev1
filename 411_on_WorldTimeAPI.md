## Provides:
This API allows you to retrieve the current time for many locations on Earth without having to consider time zones, daylight savings, and etc.

### Pain factor: 1

### Key Provisioning:
- No key necessary

### Quotas:
- Couldn't find any mention of a limit

## The Good:
- Easy to use
- No need for a personal key
- Completely free (for non-commercial purposes)
- Format is simple: https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/&lt;Area>/&lt;Location>/&lt;Optional Specific Area>.json
- Testing Example: https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/America/New_York.json

## The Bad:
- Never encountered this but the website does state: "The API can go down from time-to-time, for relatively long periods."
- Some limit on locations, but you can just make a request like https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/America.json which will show you all available locations you can choose from in America

## The Ugly:
- N/A (so far)
